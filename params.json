{"name":"ARTview","tagline":"ARM Radar Toolkit Viewer","body":"### What's this ARTview thing?\r\nARTview is an interactive GUI viewer that is built on top of the [Py-ART](https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart) toolkit for weather radar data. It offers the ability to visualize, query and edit data and is cross-platform compatible. All file types available in Py-ART can be opened with the ARTview browser.\r\nThe intent of ARTview is to provide an easy interface for novice users of weather radar data as well as provide analytical and editing tools for advanced user by leveraging the quickly maturing Py-ART code base, as well as internal features unique to ARTview.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nDocumentation for ARTview can be found in the online [documentation](https://rawgit.com/nguy/artview/master/docs/build/html/index.html) or using Python's built in help system.

A central idea in ARTview is provide \"Plugins\" that perform any sort of operation. Along with the package plugins, you can [write your own plugin](https://rawgit.com/nguy/artview/master/docs/build/html/plugin_tutorial.html). ARTview will automatically load this plugin at startup. If you think it's useful please send it to us (see Getting Help below) and it can be included in the next release. Another feature is [building your own script](https://rawgit.com/nguy/artview/master/docs/build/html/script_tutorial.html) to have components start automatically.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nThe easiest method for installing ARTview is to use the conda packages from the latest release.  To do this you must download and install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) or [Miniconda](http://continuum.io/downloads). Then use the following command in a terminal or command prompt to install the latest version of ARTview\r\n\r\n    conda install -c jjhelmus artivew\r\n\r\nTo update an older version of ARTview to the latest release use\r\n\r\n    conda update -c jjhelmus artview\r\n\r\nInstalling ARTview from source is the only way to get the latest updates and enhancements to the software that have not yet made it into official release.
