Installing from Source
======================

To install globally use

    $ python setup.py install

of locally use

    $ python setup.py install --user

If you prefer to use ARTview without installing, simply add the this path to
your PYTHONPATH (directory or with a .pth file) and compile the extension
in-place.

    $ python setup.py build_ext -i
